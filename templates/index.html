  	<h3>Welcome to the Codon Compression web tool</h3>
</div>

<div class="row" style="padding:10px 10px 30px 0px"><p style="font-size:16px;">Saturation mutagenesis is employed in protein engineering and genome-editing efforts to generate libraries that span amino acid design space. Our codon compression web tool allows users to compress degenerate codons in a user specified manner. The output provided will be a unique collection of codons for any desired amino acids. <br><br>

This tool’s purpose is to eliminate undesired amino acids, stop codons and redundancy (or bias) from the generated diversity, as occurs in the commonly used NNK codon (that includes 32 codons for 20 amino acids and includes also stop codon). <br><br>

The resulting compressed codons are optimized for the target organism codon usage, and custom genetic and usage tables can be uploaded for exotic organisms or when non-natural amino acids are in use. <br><br>

This tool contains 2 different compression approaches:<br><br> 

<u><a href="/dynamcc_0/"><strong>DYNAMCC_0</strong></a></u>:
This algorithm calculates the minimal set of degenerate codons for any desired set of amino acids, without redundancy. Note that the compressed codons may be ranked according to codon usage, or according to their usage rank, which may result in different results.<br><br>
 
For example: to include all amino acids, without redundancy and without any stop codon, optimized for <em>E. coli</em>, the compressed codon list is: VHG, NRT, WTT and TGG<br><br>

<u><a href="/dynamcc_R/"><strong>DYNAMCC_R</strong></a></u>:
This algorithm helps in finding compressed codons with various levels of redundancy. Due to the large solution space, the algorithm compresses the “best List” according to usage that constitutes a single codon for each amino acid, and then adds more codons ordered by their specific usage, until complete redundancy is achieved.<br><br>
For example: to include all amino acids, without any stop codon, optimized for <em>E. coli</em>, the compressed and fully redundant codon list is: NYA, NBG, VRA, NNY and VAG<br><br>

Additionally, we have provided the capability to "explode" a set of compressed codons:<br><br>

<u><a href="/dynamcc_d/"><strong>DYNAMCC_D</strong></a></u>:
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
<br><br>
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
<br><br>

<u><a href="/exploder/"><strong>Codon Exploder</strong></a></u>: This tools allows you to visualize the mapping of compressed codons to the corresponding collection of true codons. The usage and ranking of the "exploded codons" will be determined based on the selected organism and displayed in the output table.<br><br>
